# Auto_Differential_CIP
&nbsp;This project aims to improve the computational efficiency of the CIP method (Constrained Interpolation Profile Scheme) using automatic differentiation.

&nbsp;The base CIP method sketch is a sample code from the "はじめての音響数値シミュレーションプログラミングガイド" edited by the Acoustical Society of Japan. (http://www.openacoustics.org/)
